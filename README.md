SecureComm: Text Encryption and Decryption Using RSA

Objective 
The objective of this project is to develop a secure communication system using RSA encryption and decryption techniques. SecureComm ensures that sensitive text messages are encrypted before transmission and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient using a private key. The project aims to provide:
•	Confidentiality – Prevent unauthorized access to messages.
•	Integrity – Ensure the message is not altered during transmission.
•	Authentication – Verify the identity of the sender and receiver.
•	User-Friendly Interface – Develop an easy-to-use system for secure text communication.

Problem Statement
In today’s digital era, text communication through emails, messaging apps, and online platforms is highly vulnerable to cyber threats such as eavesdropping, hacking, and unauthorized access. Traditional communication channels lack robust security mechanisms, leading to data breaches and privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose SecureComm, a text encryption and decryption system that leverages the RSA cryptographic algorithm. This system ensures that only the intended recipient can decode the message, thus enhancing security and privacy.

Introduction
Cryptography plays a crucial role in securing digital communication. The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm is one of the most widely used public-key encryption techniques, providing strong security through mathematical principles. RSA encryption works on the principle of generating a pair of public and private keys, where the public key is used for encryption and the private key for decryption.
SecureComm implements RSA encryption to encode messages before transmission, ensuring that only users with the correct private key can decode the text. This project is particularly useful for secure messaging, confidential emails, and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
